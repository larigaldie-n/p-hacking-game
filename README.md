# p-hacking-game
A quick sarcastic game in R+Shiny set in academia. May even teach how seemingly innocent degrees of freedom in research can lead to p-hacking

UI.R and server.R are usual Shiny script files for the frontend and backend

p-value-t-test.R contains the simulation functions

Be nice regarding code quality: this was just intended as a fun week-end project. I might get back to it later if it sparks interest.
